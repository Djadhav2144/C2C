# C2C
Camera-to-Cloud (C2C) is a workflow technology that bypasses the traditional process of physically moving storage media (like SD cards or SSDs) from a camera to a computer. Instead, it transmits captured footage or images directly from the camera to a centralized cloud platform via the internet.
